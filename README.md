## Programming Language Suggester
#### _by Aaron Minnick_
### Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS (including Bootstrap)
* Javascript (Including jQuery)

This is the week 2 independent project at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com). The goal of the exercise is to take input from a form to suggest a programming language to the user. As the assignment specified we didn't have to base the suggestion on relevance to our form questions, I decided to take a creative angle, based on Blade Runner. To check out the project, click [HERE](https://aaronminnick.github.io/programming-language-suggester/). Or, follow the setup instructions below to launch the page from a local copy on your machine.

### Setup Instructions:
_(Please note, the below instructions are using gitbash on a Windows computer. Commands may vary if you are using a different OS or terminal program.)_
* Initialize a local repository in your desired location using the terminal:
```
$ git init
```
* Clone this repository to your local repository (the link may be easily got using the green "Code" button on the github page):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/aaronminnick/programming-language-suggester
```
* Open index.html with your default browser:
```
$ start index.html
```
**Or** you may use the green "Code" button to download the files to your computer. Then simply extract the package, and open index.html with your browser of choice.

### Known Bugs:
Radio buttons don't reset to their default values (topmost selected) on consecutive "plays".
